# Yellow-Pages-Webscraper
Scrape business details using Selenium and BeautifulSoup - example

This webscraper was created as an example of how Selenium and Beautiful Soup can be used to create new datasets from YellowPageCity website. 
I have not used this webscraper for any intention other than practicing coding abilities and have no intention of selling any information.
The installation of Selenium and BeautifulSoup are needed to execute the script below. The script is a test example of how to scrape a few URLs.
The same framework can modified for most websites. We can also use the same techniques to create bots or web testing purposes. 
We can also scrape dynamic websites where we need to send words into a search bar just by programming and not physically typing them. (not included here)
For a clear example on webscraping and how it works, watch the following Youtube videos from a channel called Tech With Tim.

I've made notes about the process as well in the script

Selenium - is a powerful tool for controlling web browsers 
through programs and performing browser automation. It is functional for all browsers, 
works on all major OS and its scripts are written in various languages i.e Python, Java, C#, etc

Beautiful Soup - a Python package for parsing HTML and XML documents. 
It creates a parse tree for parsed pages that can be used to extract data 
from HTML, which is useful for web scraping. 

Selenium will get us to the webpage and BeautifulSoup will get the data from that page.

Python Script is located in directory.
